            searchButton has been created. The getElementById method is then being called, passing in the ID of the button which is 
            search-button (see line 25). A total of three event listeners were created that display messages to the user that indicate 
            their search results will be ready soon. -->

                a year! Read her thoughts on Nghi Vo's "The Chosen and the Beautiful" (she's convinced all the

            <p>Donating books to local school libraries, organising charity quiz nights, and holding our very first

            <p>When we heard our local library was on the brink of shutting down, our volunteers came up with an
                unlikely idea to help keep Knightsbridge Library's doors open. Find out all about their extraordinary
                work.</p>

            <figcaption>Volunteers band together to save their local library! When staff at Knightsbridge Library were
                told that they would no longer recieve funding, they started online petitons for the library to remain
                open. These recieved an overwhelming number of responses from local residents who have highlighted the
                library's longstanding history in the community since 1902.</figcaption>
