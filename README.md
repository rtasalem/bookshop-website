# Bookshop Website
## About
This is the first website I ever made. The original version was presented and submitted as part of my training as a software developer. Only the landing page was created, but moving forward I hope to continue developing this more as I learn more about front- and back-end web design. 
# Background
Initially, the assignment was to create a webpage based off of a wireframe for a charity website, however I decided to specifically create a landing page for a charity bookshop. This was inspired by how my friend and I will often say we want to open a bookshop together. 
Hypothetically speaking, I suppose this is what I would envision the website to look for said bookshop.
