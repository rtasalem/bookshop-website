# Bookshop Website
### About
This is the first website I ever made. This was submitted as part of my training as a software developer. Only the landing page was created.
## Getting Started
To view the website, open the project in VS Code and ensure that you have a live server/live preview extension installed (I use [Live Server by Ritwick Dey](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)). Run the extension to view the website.
